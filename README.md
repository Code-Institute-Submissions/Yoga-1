# Milestone 4 - SpiritusYoga.no

## Description
---

This is my 4th. and final Milestone in the Full Stack Software developer course With Code Institue.
In our final project we will show the skills that we've learn through out the course and the project
needs to be a fullstack project. We got different scopes to choose from and I have chosen a project 
that I've made for a friend after I had finished my MS1. The project only consists of HTML and CSS, but 
I will upgrade the project to a Full Stack Project and allow the customers to create an account and
make purchase directly inside the webpage. The language for the site is Norwegian. 

The project is a Yoga site for a friend that have a small Yogastudio where people can come and teach about 
Yoga and practice yoga. She is a certified Yoga instructor and offering three different kinds of sessions. 
The site will offer basic information about the 
  
## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
